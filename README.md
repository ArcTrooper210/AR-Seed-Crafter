# AR-Seed-Crafter
AR Seed Crafter is a revival/continuation of HG Seed Crafter. [HG] Hulk has discontinued modding.

This build should be working, but I cannot guarantee that it will. As a beginner modder I will do my best to keep this mod working as intended. This mod is still a work-in-progress as I dig through the mod and figure out what [HG] Hulk's original intent was.

Check out [HG] Hulk's Mod Collection!: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=688521554

DISCLAIMER: All in-game structure names and items have HG removed, but the mod files still contain HG. I have tried removing all instances of HG, but each time I have tried, it has corrupted/broken mod functionality. Unless explicitly stated, I do not claim to have written any code or made any of the assets.
